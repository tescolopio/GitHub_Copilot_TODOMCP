# MCP TODO Management System

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides GitHub Copilot in VS Code with autonomous TODO management capabilities. This system enables Copilot to automatically discover, review, edit, complete, and create TODOs in your codebase, maintaining continuous autonomous development while incomplete TODOs exist.

This project is inspired by the work of [PawiX25/copilot-auto-continue](https://github.com/PawiX25/copilot-auto-continue).

## üåü Features

- **TODO Discovery & Management**: Automatically finds and manages TODO comments in your codebase and integrates with TODO extensions
- **Autonomous Continuation**: Continuously works on incomplete TODOs until all are resolved or marked as complete
- **GitHub Copilot Integration**: Specifically designed to work with GitHub Copilot in VS Code for seamless AI-powered development
- **Session Management**: Maintains session state, allowing for recovery from crashes and long-running TODO completion sessions
- **Safety and Validation**: Includes safety pattern matching and validation tools to ensure code changes are safe and correct
- **Tool-Based Architecture**: Provides MCP tools for file system operations, git operations, and code validation
- **VS Code Extension**: Deep integration with Visual Studio Code for a seamless user experience
- **Extensible Pattern Matching**: Smart pattern recognition for different types of TODOs and appropriate completion strategies
- **Configuration Management**: Easily configurable through a `config.json` file to customize TODO handling behavior
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging using Winston for tracking TODO completion progress and debugging
