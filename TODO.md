# TODO List

This list tracks the next steps for the MCP Autonomous Development System.

## 🔧 Immediate Fixes (Priority: CRITICAL)

- [x] **Fix Duplicate Pattern Issue**: ~~Remove the duplicate `implement-function` pattern definition in `SafePatterns.ts` (line 114+)~~ ✅ RESOLVED
  - ~~Keep only the more comprehensive first definition with better regex and requirements~~
  - ~~Ensure pattern IDs are unique across the system~~
  - **STATUS**: No duplicate patterns found - this was likely a documentation error

## ✅ Recent Accomplishments

### Enhanced Variable Renaming with AST Analysis ✅

Successfully implemented AST-based variable renaming that:
1. **Safely parses TypeScript/JavaScript files** using the TypeScript compiler API
2. **Identifies variables by scope** to avoid renaming unrelated identifiers
3. **Creates automatic backups** before making changes
4. **Provides detailed feedback** on replacements made
5. **Auto-approvable** with 90% confidence (up from 75%)

### Function Implementation Tool ✅

Added intelligent function stub detection and implementation with:
1. **Multiple strategies** (conservative, balanced, creative)
2. **Purpose inference** from function names and signatures
3. **Type-aware generation** for TypeScript files
4. **Full MCP server integration**
