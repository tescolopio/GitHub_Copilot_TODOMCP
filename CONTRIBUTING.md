- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Basic knowledge of TypeScript and MCP (Model Context Protocol)

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/GitHub_Copilot_TODOMCP.git
   cd GitHub_Copilot_TODOMCP
   ```
3. **Add the upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/tescolopio/GitHub_Copilot_TODOMCP.git
   ```
4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
5. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```
6. **Run the tests** to ensure everything is working:
   ```bash
   pnpm test
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a new branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
3. **Add tests** for your changes
4. **Run the test suite**:
   ```bash
   pnpm test
   ```
5. **Run the linter**:
   ```bash
   pnpm lint
   ```
6. **Build the project** to ensure it compiles:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

### Code Style and Standards

- **TypeScript**: We use TypeScript with strict type checking
- **ESLint**: Follow the existing ESLint configuration
- **Prettier**: Code formatting is handled by Prettier
- **Testing**: Use Jest for unit tests
- **Logging**: Use the Winston logger from `src/utils/logger`

### Commit Guidelines

We use conventional commits to maintain a clean git history:

- `feat:` New features
- `fix:` Bug fixes
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

Example:

```
feat: add support for custom TODO patterns
fix: resolve session recovery issue
docs: update README with new installation steps
```

## üß™ Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for new functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Add integration tests for complex features
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for good test coverage on new code
- **Manual Testing**: Test your changes with VS Code and GitHub Copilot

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Generate coverage report
pnpm test:coverage
```

## üìù Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** if needed
2. **Ensure all tests pass**
3. **Update the CHANGELOG.md** if applicable
4. **Create a pull request** with a clear title and description
5. **Link any related issues** in the PR description
6. **Request review** from maintainers

### Pull Request Template

When creating a pull request, please include:

- **Description**: What does this PR do?
- **Type of Change**: Bug fix, new feature, documentation, etc.
- **Testing**: How was this tested?
- **Checklist**:
  - [ ] Tests pass
  - [ ] Code follows style guidelines
  - [ ] Self-review completed
  - [ ] Documentation updated

## üêõ Reporting Issues

When reporting issues, please include:

- **Environment**: OS, Node.js version, VS Code version
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Expected behavior**
- **Actual behavior**
- **Screenshots or logs** if applicable
- **TODO-related context** if the issue involves TODO management

## üí° Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests! Please:

- **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicates
- **Describe the feature** and its use case
- **Explain how it fits** with the TODO management focus
- **Consider backward compatibility**

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### MCP Tools

- Follow the existing MCP tool patterns
- Ensure tools are focused on TODO management
- Add proper error handling and logging
- Include comprehensive JSDoc comments

### TODO Management

- Consider different TODO formats and extensions
- Ensure safety checks are in place
- Maintain session state properly
- Follow the autonomous continuation pattern

### VS Code Integration

- Test with GitHub Copilot specifically
- Consider different workspace scenarios
- Ensure proper extension lifecycle management

## üîí Security Guidelines

### Handling Sensitive Data

- **Never commit** real credentials, tokens, or API keys
- **Use example files** for configuration templates
- **Test with mock data** instead of real user data
- **Sanitize logs** before including in issues or PRs

### Code Security

- **Validate all inputs** from configuration files
- **Use path sanitization** for file operations
- **Implement proper error handling** without exposing internals
- **Follow principle of least privilege** for file access

### Reporting Security Issues

- **Do not** create public issues for security vulnerabilities
- **Contact maintainers** privately (see SECURITY.md)
- **Wait for patches** before disclosing publicly
