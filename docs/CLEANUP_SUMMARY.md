### Duplicate Demo Files

- Removed `demo-unused-variables.tsx` from root directory (kept organized version in `demos/`)
- Removed redundant demo files: `demo-showcase.ts`, `demo-functions.ts`, `demo-comprehensive.ts`
- Kept the most comprehensive and working versions

- Cleaned up `sample-workspace/.mcp-backups/` (41 backup files)
- Cleaned up `sample-workspace/.mcp-replays/` and `sample-workspace/.mcp-sessions/`
- Removed empty `scripts/` directory after moving demo files to `demos/`

### Log Files

- Cleared large log files (`logs/error.log` and `logs/mcp-server.log`) but kept files for future logging
- Removed approximately 2.3MB of accumulated log data

## Files Reorganized

### Demo Files

- Moved `scripts/demo-action-replay.ts` and `scripts/demo-error-context.ts` to `demos/` directory
- All demo and test files now properly organized in the `demos/` folder

## Documentation Updated

### `demos/README.md`

- Updated to reflect current demo file structure
- Added proper categorization (Core Demonstrations, Test Files, Development Demos)
- Fixed Markdown formatting issues
- Added comprehensive usage instructions
